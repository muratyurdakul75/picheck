PiCheck version 21.1.0 has been released.

1. Fixed an issue with connection warnings experienced by some users.
2. Fixed an issue with automatic page refresh times. Pages were updating more frequently than they should, creating unnecessary load.

*** IMPORTANT WARNING ***
PiCheck 20 and older versions are not compatible with PiNode 0.5.4 and do not accurately display Network Health values. To see this value correctly, you need to use PiCheck 21 or a newer version.
