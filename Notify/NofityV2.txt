**** IMPORTANT INFORMATION ****
Recently, there have been issues with the Pi Network. To see accurate Network Health information in the PiCheck application, you need to use PiCheck version 21. Older versions are incompatible with Pi Node 0.5.4 and therefore display incorrect Network Health information.

If you think I deserve some coffee money, you can make a Coffee Donation from the Settings page. :)
